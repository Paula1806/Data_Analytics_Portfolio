# My Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me

I am a data-driven professional on a learning journey to enhance my analytical skills and unlock the power of data. I have a bachelor's in Business Management and over 8 years of working experience in business development, marketing and sales in different industries. 
To nurture my passion for extracting data insights and eagerness to transition my career to the data analytics field, I decided to pursue a Business Analytics postgraduate degree where I am acquiring the skills to generate business insights by developing and using databases, big data and machine learning. 

This portfolio reflects my journey into the analytcis field.
